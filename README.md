This is a file/directory tree implementation that my partner (Jack) and
I wrote last semester for a COS217 assignment.

Here are the descriptions of the files included in the sample:

    NodeD.c: An implementation of the directory node data type used in FT
    NodeD.h: The interface file for the NodeD data type

    NodeF.c: An implementation of the file node data type used in FT
    NodeF.h: The interface file for the NodeF data type

    ft.c: The implementation of the file tree itself

    checkerFT.c: A module that checks the invariants of the file tree nodes
    checkerFT.h: The interface file for the checkerFT data type

In the assignment, we were given various header files and other modules
that we used in the final executable, but I'm pretty sure I'm not
allowed to share those, so I just included the code that I wrote.
